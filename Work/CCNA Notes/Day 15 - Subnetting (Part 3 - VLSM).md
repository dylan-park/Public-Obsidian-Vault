- **VLSN** - Variable-Length Subnet Masks
	- The process of creating subnets of different sizes, to make your use of network addresses more efficient
	1. Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space
	2. Assign the second-largest subnet after it.
	3. Repeat the process until all subnets have been assigned (from largest to smallest)
