## Day 5

- **LAN** - A network contained within a small area
	- Routers are used to connect separate LANs
- ### Ethernet Header: ^ccna-ethernet-header
	- #### Preamble
		- Length: 7 bytes
		- Alternating 1's and 0's (10101010*7)
		- Allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks
	- #### SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)
		- Length: 1 byte
		- 10101011
		- Marks the end of the preamble and the beginning of the rest of the frame
		- Preamble and SFD are used for synchronization, and mark the head of the frame, but are usually not considered part of the Ethernet header
	- #### Destination
		- Length: 6 bytes
		- The layer 2 (MAC) address to which the frame is being sent
	- #### Source
		- Length: 6 bytes
		- The layer 2 (MAC) address of the device which sent the frame
	- #### Type/Length
		- Length: 2 bytes
		- A value of 1536 or greater in this field Indicates the layer 3 protocol used in the encapsulated packet
			- Is almost always IPv4 or IPv6
				- IPv4 = 0x0800 (2048 in decimal)
				- IPv6 = 0x86DD (34525 in decimal)
		- A value of 1500 of less in this field indicates the length instead of type
- ### Ethernet Trailer:
	- #### FCS
		- Length: 4 bytes
		- Detects corrupted data by running a 'CRC' (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm over the received data
- Ethernet Frame Header + Trailer = 18 bytes
- The minimum size for an Ethernet Frame (Header + Payload \[Packet\] + Trailer) is 64 bytes
	- 64 bytes - 18 byes (header + trailer) = 46 bytes (minimum payload/packet size)
	- If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added (all 0's)
- ### MAC - Media Access Control
	- 6 byte (48 bit) address of the physical device
	- BIA (Burned-In Address)
	- Globally unique
	- The first 3 bytes are the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), which is assigned to the company making the device
	- The last 3 bytes are unique to the device itself
	- Written as 12 hexadecimal characters
- **Unicast frame** - a frame destined for a single target
	- **Unknown Unicast frame** - a frame for which a switch does not have the destination in its mac address table
		- Flood frame - sends out the frame to all available interfaces to find the correct one
	- **Known Unicast frame** - a frame destined for a target the switch already has in its mac address table
		- Forward frame
- On Cisco switches, dynamic MAC addresses are removed from the MAC address table after 5 minutes of inactivity (Aging)

## Day 6

- **ARP** - Address Resolution Protocol
	- Used to discover the Layer 2 address (MAC) of a known Layer 3 address (IP)
	- Consists of two messages:
		- ARP Request
			- Broadcast: sent to all hosts on the network
			- FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
		- ARP Reply
			- Unicast: sent only to one host (the one that sent the request)
	- `arp -a` to view the ARP table on Windows
	- `show arp` to view the ARP table on Cisco IOS
- **Ping** - A network utility that is used to test reachability
	- Measures round-trip time
	- Uses two messages:
		- ICMP Echo Request
		- ICMP Echo Reply
- `show mac address-table` to view MAC Address table on Cisco IOS
- `clear mac address-table dynamic` to clear the dynamic MAC Addresses on the table
	- `clear mac address-table dynamic address *mac-address*` to clear only specified MAC Address from the table
	- `clear mac address-table dynamic interface *interface-id*` to clear all MAC Addresses from a specific interface from the table
