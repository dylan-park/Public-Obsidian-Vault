- **LAN** - A single broadcast domain 
- **Broadcast Domain** - The group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame (destination MAC FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by any one of the members
- **Subnet** - A broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the network layer (Layer 3)
- ## VLAN - A broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (Layer 2)
	- Configured on switches on a per-interface basis
	- Logically separate end hosts at Layer 2
	- Switches do not forward traffic directly between hosts in different VLANs (This is designated to the router)
- `show vlan brief` command shows basic VLAN info
	- By default, all ports are in VLAN 1 by default
	- VLANs 1, 1002-1005 exit by default and cannot be deleted
- ### Configure VLAN: ^ccna-configure-vlan
	- Select interface: 'interface (range) *interfaces*'
	- `switchport mode access` command sets ports as access ports
		- An access port is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts like PCs
	- `switchport access vlan *vlan-id*`
	- `vlan *vlan-id*` command enters config mode for VLAN (Will create a VLAN if one does not exist)
		- `name *name*` command sets VLAN name
