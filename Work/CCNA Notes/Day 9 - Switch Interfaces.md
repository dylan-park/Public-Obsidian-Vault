- Cisco switches do not have the shutdown command applied to interfaces by default
	- Interfaces will usually be up/up (Up status, up protocol) by default when a device is plugged in to them
- `show interfaces status` command provides different information from the show ip address brief command
	- Indicates port, description (name), status, vlan, duplex, speed, and type of each interface
- `interface range *interface-range*` command to enter interface config mode for multiple interfaces at once
	- f0/5 - 12
	- Can separate the ranges w/ commas: f0/5 - 6, f0/9 - 12
- **Half duplex** - The device cannot send and receive data at the same time.
	- If it is receiving a frame, it must wait before sending a frame.
	- Devices attached to a hub must operate in half duplex
- **Full duplex** - The device can send and receive data at the same time.
	- It does not have to wait
	- Devices attached to a switch can operate in full duplex
- Ethernet Hub
	- Layer 1 devices
- **CSMA/CD** - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection ^ccna-csmacd
	- Used w/ network hubs in half duplex networks
	- Before sending frames, devices 'listen' to the collision domain until they detect that other devices are not sending.
	- If a collision does occur, the device sends a jamming signal to inform the other devices that a collision happened.
	- Each device will wait a random period of time before sending frames again.
	- The process repeats.
- Interfaces that can run at different speeds have default settings of speed: auto and duplex: auto.
	- Interfaces 'advertise' their capabilities to the neighboring device, and they negotiate the best speed and duplex settings they are both capable of
- What if auto-negotiation is disabled on the device connected to the switch?
	- Speed: The switch will try to sense the speed that the other device is operating at.
		- If it fails to sense the speed, it will use the slowest supported speed.
	- Duplex: If the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps, the switch will use half duplex. If the speed is 1000Mbps or greater, it will use full duplex
- ## Interface errors:
	- Runts - Frames that are smaller than the minimum frame size (64 bytes)
	- Giants - Frames that are larger than the maximum frame size 91518 bytes)
	- CRC - Frames that failed the CRC check (in the Ethernet FCS trailer)
	- Frame - Frames that have an incorrect format (due to error)
	- Input errors - Total of various counters, such as the above four
	- Output errors - Frames the switch tried to send, but failed due to an error
