- ## ACLs (Access Control Lists)
	- ACLs function as a packet filter, instructing the router to permit or discard specific traffic
	- ACLs can filter traffic based on
		- Source/Destination IP addresses
		- Source/Destination Layer 4 ports
		- Etc.
	- ### Example Setup
		- ![[Pasted image 20240330010604.png]]
		- #### Requirements
			- Hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 can access the 10.0.1.0/24 network
			- Hosts in 192.168.2.0/24 cannot access the 10.0.1.0/24 network
		- #### ACL 1
			1. if source IP = 192.168.1.0/24, then permit
			2. if source IP = 192.168.2.0/24, then deny
			3. if source IP = any, then permit
	- ACLs are configured globally on the router (global config mode)
	- They are an ordered sequence of ACEs (Access Control Entries)
		- When the router checks a packet against the ACL, it processes the ACEs in order, from top to bottom
		- If the packet matches one of the ACEs in the ACL, the router takes the action and stops processing the ACL
		- All entries below the matching entry will be ignored
	- Configuring an ACL in global config mode will not make the ACL take effect
		- The ACL must be applied to an interface
		- ACLs are applied either inbound or outbound
	- A maximum of one ACL can be applied to a single interface <u>per direction</u>
	- ### Implicit Deny
		- What will happen if a packet doesn't match any of the entries in an ACL
		- There is an 'implicit deny' at the end of all ACLs
			- Ex. if source IP = any, then deny
		- The implicit deny tells the router to deny all traffic that doesn't match any of the configured entries in the ACL
- ### ACL Types
	- #### Standard ACLs
		- Match based on **Source IP address** only
		- ##### Standard Numbered ACLs
			- Numbered ACLs are identified with a number (i.e. ACL 1, ACL 2, etc.)
			- Standard ACLs can use 1-99 and 1300-1999
			- `access-list *number* *deny | permit* *ip* *wildcard-mask*` command configures a standard numbered ACL
				- If you supply a /32 address, you do not need to provide a wildcard mask
			- `access-list *number* remark *comment*` command adds a comment to the ACL
			- `ip access-group *number* *in | out*` command from interface mode applies an ACL to an interface
		- ##### Standard Named ACLs
			- Named ACLs are identified with a name
				- Standard named ACLs are configured by entering ACL config mode, and then configuring each entry within that config mode
				- `ip access-list standard *acl-name*` command enters ACL config mode
					- `*entry-number* *deny | permit* *ip* *wildcard-mask*` command adds an entry
			- Advantages:
				- You can easily delete individual entries in the ACL with the `no *entry number` command
					- When configuring/editing numbered ACLs from global config mode, you can't delete individual entries, you can only delete the entire ACL
				- You can insert new entries in between other entries by specifying the sequence number
		- The router may re-order the /32 entries in a standard ACL, this improves the efficiency of processing the ACL without changing the effect
		- Standard ACLs should be applied as close to the destination as possible
	- #### [[Day 35 - Extended ACLs|Extended ACLs]]
		- Match based on Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination port, etc.

		- ##### Extended Named ACLs
