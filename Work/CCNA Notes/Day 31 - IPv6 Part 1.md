- ## Why IPv6?
	- The main reason is that there aren't enough IPv4 addresses available
		- There are 4,294,967,296 (2^32) IPv4 addresses available
	-  An IPv6 address is 128 bits
		- There are 340,282,366,920,938,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (2^128) IPv6 addresses
	- VLSM, private IPv4 addresses, and NAT have been used to conserve the use of IPv4 address space, but are short term solutions
- ## IPv4 Address Assignment:
	- IPv4 address assignments are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
	- IANA distributes address space to various RIRs (Regional Internet Registries), which then assign them to companies that need them
- ## Shortening IPv6 Addresses
	- **Leading 0s** can be removed
		- 2001:**0**DB8:**000**A:**00**1B:20A1:**00**20:**00**80:34BD → 2001:DB8:A:1B:20A1:20:80:34BD
	- **Consecutive quartets of all 0s** can be replaced with a double colon (:\:)
		- 2001:0DB8:**0000:0000:0000:0000**:0080:34BD → 2001:0DB8::0080:34BD
		- Consecutive quartets of 0s can only be abbreviated once in an IPv6 address
	- Combine both methods:
		- 2001:DB8::80:34BD
- ## Expanding Shortened IPv6 Addresses
	- Put leading 0s where needed (all quartets should have 4 hexadecimal characters)
		- FE80::2:0:0:FBE8 → FE80::0002:0000:0000:FBE8
	- If a double colon is used, replace it with all-0 quartets. Make sure there are 8 quartets in total
		- FE80::0002:0000:0000:FBE8 → FE80:0000:0000:0000:0002:0000:0000:FBE8
- ## Finding the IPv6 Prefix (Global Unicast Addresses)
	- Typically, an enterprise requesting IPv6 addresses from their ISP will receive a /48 block
	- Typically, IPv6 subnets use a /64 prefix length
	- That means an enterprise has 16 bits to use to make subnets
	- The remaining 64 bits can be used for hosts

		- To find the IPv6 prefix length, make the second half all 0s
			- 2001:0DB8:8B00:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001/64 → 2001:DB8:8B00:1::/64

- ## Configuring IPv6 Addresses
	- `ipv6 unicast-routing` command allows the router to perform IPv6 routing
		- Router will not use IPv6 addresses otherwise
	- `ipv6 address *address*/*prefix length*` command sets address
	- `show ipv6 interface brief` command shows ipv6 interface info
