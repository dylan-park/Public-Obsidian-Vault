- ## LAN Architectures
	- There are standard 'best practices' for network design, however there are few universal 'correct answers'
		- The answer to most general questions about network design is 'it depends'.
	- ### Star
		- When several devices all connect to one central device, we can draw them in a 'star' shape

	- ### Full Mesh
		- When each device is connected to each other device
		- ![[Assets/Pasted image 20240429165727.png]]
	- ### Partial Mesh
		- When some devices are connected to each other, but not all

- ## Two-Tier LAN Design
	- The two-tier LAN design consists of two hierarchical layers:
		- **Access Layer**
			- The layer that end hosts connect to (PCs, printers, cameras, etc.)
			- Typically, Access Layer switches have lots of ports for end users to connect to
			- QoS marking is typically done here
			- Security services like [[Day 49 - Port Security#^ccna-port-security|port security]], SAI, etc. are typically performed here
			- Switchports might be PoE-enabled for wireless APs, IP phones, etc.
		- **Distribution Layer**
			- Aggregates connections from the Access Layer Switches
			- Typically is the border between Layer 2 and Layer 3
			- Connects to services such as Internet, WAN, etc.
	- Also called a 'Collapsed Core' design because it omits a layer that is found in the Three Tier design: the **Core Layer**
	- ![[Assets/Pasted image 20240429170821.png]]
	- In large LAN networks with many Distribution Layer switches (for example in separate buildings), the number of connections required between Distribution Layer switches grows rapidly
		- To help scale large LAN networks, you can add a Core Layer
		- Cisco recommends adding a Core Layer if there are more than three Distribution Layers in a single location
- ## Three-Tier LAN Design
	- The three-tier LAN design consists of three hierarchical layers:
		- **Access Layer**
		- **Distribution Layer**
		- Core Layer
			- Connects Distribution Layers together in large LAN networks
			- The focus is speed (fast transport)
			- CUP-intensive operations such as security, QoS marking/classification, etc. should be avoided at this layer
			- Connections are all Layer 3, no spanning tree
			- Should maintain connectivity throughout the LAN even if devices fail

- ## Spine-Leaf Architecture
	- Data centers are dedicated spaces/buildings used to store computer systems such as servers and network devices
	- Traditional data center designs used a three-tier architecture
		- This worked well when most traffic in the data center was North-South
		- ![[Assets/Pasted image 20240429171722.png]]
	- With the precedence of virtual servers, applications are often deployed in a distributed manner (across multiple physical servers), which increases the amount of East-West traffic in the data center
	- The traditional three-tier architecture led to bottlenecks in bandwidth as well as variability in the server-to-server latency depending on the path the traffic takes
	- ![[Assets/Pasted image 20240429171937.png]]
	- There are some rules about Spine-Leaf architecture:
		- Every Leaf switch is connected to every Spine switch
		- Every Spine switch is connected to every Leaf switch
		- Leaf switches do not connect to other Leaf switches
		- Spine switches do not connect to other Spine switches
		- End hosts (servers, etc.) only connect to Leaf switches
	- The path taken by traffic is randomly chosen, to balance the traffic load among the Spine switches
	- Each server is separated by the same number of 'hops' (except those connected to the same Leaf), providing consistent latency for East-West traffic
	- Easy to scale
- ## SOHO Networks
	- Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) refers to the office of a small company, or a small home office with few devices
		- Doesn't have to be an actual home 'office', if your home has a network connected to the Internet it is considered a SOHO network
	- SOHO networks don't have complex needs, so all networking functions are typically provided by a single device, often called a 'home router' or 'wireless router'
	- This one device can serve as a:
		- Router
		- Switch
		- Firewall
		- Wireless Access Point
		- Modem (sometimes a separate device instead)
