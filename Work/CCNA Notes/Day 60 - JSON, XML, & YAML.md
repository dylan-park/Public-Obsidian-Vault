- ## Data Serialization
	- Data serialization is the process of converting data into a standardized format/structure that can be stored (in a file) or transmitted (over a network) and reconstructed later (i.e. by a different application)
		- This allows the data to be communicated between applications in a way both applications understand
	- Data serialization language allow us to represent *variables* with text
		- Variables are containers that store values
- ## JSON ^ccna-json
	- **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard **file format** and **data interchange format** that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects
	- It is standardized in [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)
	- It was derived from JavaScript, but it is language-independent and many modern programming languages are able to generate and read JSON data
		- REST APIs often use JSON
	- *Whitespace* is insignificant
	- JSON can represent four 'primitive' data types:
		- ### String
			- A **string** is a text value
			- It is surrounded by double quotes " "
		- ### Number
			- A **number** is a numeric value
			- It is not surrounded by quotes
		- ### Boolean
			- A **boolean** is a data type that has only two possible values
				- true and false
			- Not surrounded by quotes
		- ### Null
			- A **null** value represents the intentional absence of any object value
			- It is not surrounded by quotes
	- JSON also has two 'structured' data types:
		- ### Object
			- An **object** is an unordered list of *key-value pairs* (variables)
			- Objects are surrounded by curly brackets {}
			- The *key* is a string
			- The *value* is any valid JSON data type (string, number, boolean, null, object, array)
			- The *key* and *value* are separated by a colon :
			- If there are multiple key-value pairs, each pair is separated by a comma
			- Sometimes called a **dictionary**
		- ### Array
			- An **array** is a series of values separated by commas
				- Not *key-value pairs*
				- The values don't have to be the same data type
- ## XML ^ccna-xml
	- **XLM** (Extensible Markup Language) was developed as a markup language, but is now used as a general data serialization language
		- Markup languages (i.e. HTLM) are used to format text (front, size, color, headings, etc.)
	- XML is generally less human-readable than JSON
	- Whitespace is insignificant
	- Often used by REST APIs
	- \<key>value\</key>
- ## YAML
	- **YAML** originally meant *Yet Another Markup Language*, but to distinguish its purpose as a data-serialization language rather than a markup language, it was repurposed to *YAML Ain't Markup Language*
	- YAML is used by the network automation tool [[Day 63 - Ansible, Puppet, & Chef#^ccna-ansible|Ansible]]
	- YAML is very human-readable
	- Whitespace **is significant**, and indentation is very important
	- YAML files start with ---
	- - is used to indicate a list
	- Keys and values are represented as key:value
