- ## RIP:
	- Routing Information Protocol (Industry standard)
	- Distance vector IGP (uses routing-by-rumor logic to learn/share routes)
	- Uses hop count as its metric
		- One router = one hop (bandwidth is irrelevant)
	- Maximum hop count is 15
		- Anything more than that is considered unreachable
	- ### Uses two message types:
		- #### Request:
			- To ask RIP-enabled neighbor routers to send their r outing table
		- #### Response:
			- To send the local router's routing table to neighboring routers
	- By default, RIP-enabled routers will share their routing table every 30 seconds
	- ### Versions:
		- #### RIPv1:
			- Only advertises *classful* addresses (Class A, Class B, Class C)
			- Doesn't support VLSM, CIDR
			- Doesn't include the subnet mask information in advertisements (Response messages)
				- 10.1.1.0/24 will become 10.0.0.0 (Class A address, so assumed to be /8)
				- 172.16.192.0/18 will become 172.16.0.0 (Class B address, so assumed to be /16)
				- 192.168.1.4/30 will become 192.168.1.0 (Class C address, so assumed to be /24)
			- Messages are broadcast to 255.255.255.255
		- #### RIPv2:
			- Supports VLSM, CIDR
			- Includes subnet mask info in advertisements
			- Messages are multicast to 224.0.0.9
		- #### RIPng
	- ### Commands:
		- `router rip` command enters RIP config mode
			- `version *version*` command sets RIP version (always use 2)
			- `no auto-summary` command turns off auto-summary (stops automatically converting the networks the router advertises to classful networks, on by default)
			- `network *ip-address*` command tells the router to:
				- Look for interfaces with an ip address that is in the specified range
				- Activate RIP on the interfaces that fall in the range
				- Form adjacencies with connected RIP neighbors
				- Advertise **the network prefix of the interface** (NOT the prefix in the **network** command)
			- The network command is classful
			- `passive-interface *interface*` command configures an interface as a passive interface
				- Tells the router to stop sending RIP advertisements out of the specified interface
				- You should always use this command on interfaces which don't have any RIP neighbors
			- `default-information originate` command advertises the default route via RIP
			- `maximum-paths *number*` command sets maximum RIP paths
			- `distance *number*` command sets administrative distance
		- `show ip protocols` command shows routing protocol info
- ## EIGRP:
	- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
	- Was Cisco proprietary, but Cisco has not published it openly so other vendors can implement it on their equipment
	- Considered an 'advanced' / 'hybrid' distance vector routing protocol
	- Much faster than RIP in reacting to changes in the network
	- Does not have the 15 'hop-count' limit of RIP
	- Sends messages using multicast address 224.0.0.10
	- Is the only IGP that can perform **unequal**-cost load-balancing
		- By default it performs ECMP load-balancing over 4 paths like RIP
	- ### Commands:
		- `router eigrp *as-number*` command enters EIRGP config mode (AS number must match between routers, or they will not form an adjacency and share route information)
			- `no auto-summary` command turns off auto-summary (stops automatically converting the networks the router advertises to classful networks, on by default)
			- `passive-interface *interface*` command configures an interface as a passive interface
			- `network *ip-address*` command tells the router to:
				- Look for interfaces with an ip address that is in the specified range
				- Activate EIGRP on the interfaces that fall in the range
				- Form adjacencies with connected EIGRP neighbors
				- Advertise **the network prefix of the interface** (NOT the prefix in the **network** command)
				- Uses a wildcard mask instead of a regular subnet mask
			- `variance *variance-multiplier*` command sets the metric variance multiplier
				- **Variance 1** - only ECMP load-balancing will be performed (default)
				- **Variance 2** - **Feasible successor** routes with an FD up to 2x the **successor** route's FD can be used to load-balance
				- **Variance n** - **Feasible successor** routes with an FD up to nx the **successor** route's FD can be used to load-balance
				- EIGRP will only perform unequal-cost load-balancing over **feasible successor** routes
					- If a router doesn't meet the feasibility requirement, it will NEVER be selected for load-balancing, regardless of the **variance**
		- `show ip protocols` command shows routing protocol info
		- `show ip eigrp neighbors` command shows EIGRP neighbors
		- `show ip eigrp topology` command shows EIGRP topology information
	- ## EIGRP Router ID Priority:
		1. Manual Configuration
		2. Highest Loopback Interface Address
		3. Highest Physical Interface Address
	- ## EIGRP Metric:
		- By default, EIGRP uses **bandwidth** and **delay** to calculate metric
			- (\[K1 * bandwidth + (K2 * bandwidth) / (256 - load) + K3 * delay\] * \[K5 / (reliability + K4)\]) * 256*
			- Default 'K' values are:
				- K1 = 1
				- K2 = 0
				- K3 = 1
				- K4 = 0
				- K5 = 0
			- You can simplify the formula like this: metric = bandwidth + delay
		- Bandwidth of the **slowest link** + the delay of **all links**
	- **Feasible Distance** - This router's metric value to the route's destination
	- **Reported Distance (Advertised Distance)** - The neighbor's metric value to the route's destination
	- **Successor** - The route with the lowest metric to the destination (the best route)
	- **Feasible Successor** - An alternate route to the destination (not the best route) <u>which meets the feasibility condition</u>
		- A route is considered a **feasible successor** if its **reported distance** is lower than the **successor** route's **feasible distance**
- ## Wildcard Mask:
	- Basically an 'inverted' subnet mask
	- All 1s in the subnet mask are 0 in the equivalent wildcard mask, and vise versa.
	- '0' in the wildcard mask = must match
	- '1' in the wildcard mask = don't have to match

	- A shortcut is to subtract each octet of the subnet mask from 255
