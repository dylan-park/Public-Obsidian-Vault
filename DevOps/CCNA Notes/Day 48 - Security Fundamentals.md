- ## CIA Triad
	- The principles of the **CIA Triad** form the foundation of security:
		- **C**onfidentiality
			- Only authorized users should be able to access data
			- Some information/data is public and can be accessed by anyone, some is secret and should only be accessed by specific people
		- **I**ntegrity
			- Data should not be tampered with (modified) by unauthorized users
			- Data should be correct and authentic
		- **A**vailability
			- The network/systems should be operational and accessible to authorized users
	- Attackers can threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an enterprise's systems and information
- ## Security Concepts
	- A **vulnerability** is any potential weakness that can compromise the CIA of a system/info
		- A potential weakness isn't a problem on its own
	- An **exploit** is something that can potentially be used to exploit a vulnerability
		- Something that can *potentially* be used as an exploit isn't a problem on its own
	- A **threat** is the potential of a **vulnerability** to be **exploited**
		- A hacker exploiting a vulnerability in your system is a **threat**
	- A **mitigation technique** is something that can protect against threats
		- Should be implemented everywhere a vulnerability can be exploited: client devices, servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
	- No system is perfectly secure
- ## Common Attacks
	- ### DoS (Denial-of-Service)
		- DoS attacks threaten the availability of the system
		- One common DoS attack is the TCP SYN flood
			- [[Day 30 - TCP & UDP#^ccna-three-way-handshake|TCP three-way handshake]]: SYN | SYN-ACK | ~~ACK~~
			- The attacker sends countless TCP SYN messages to the target
			- The target sends a SYN-ACK message in response to each SYN it receives
			- The attacker never replies with the final ACK of the TCP three-way handshake
			- The incomplete connections fill up the target's TCP connection table
			- The attacker continues sending SYN messages
			- The target is no longer able to make legitimate TCP connections
		- In a DDoS (Distributed Denial-Of-Service) attack, the attacker infects many target computers with malware and uses them all to initiate a denial-of-service attack, for example, a TCP SYN flood attack
			- This group of infected computers is called a **botnet**
	- ### Spoofing
		- To **spoof** an address is to use a fake source address (IP or MAC address)
		- Numerous attacks involve spoofing, it's not a single kind of attack
		- An example is a **DHCP exhaustion** attack: ^ccna-dhcp-exhaustion
			- An attacker uses spoofed MAC addresses to flood DHCP Discover messages
			- The target server's DHCP pool becomes full, resulting in a denial-of-service to other devices
	- ### Reflection/Amplification
		- In a **reflection** attack, the attacker sends traffic to a reflector, and spoofs the source address of its packets using the target's IP address
			- The reflector (i.e. a DNS server) sends the reply to the target's IP address
			- If the amount of traffic sent to the target is large enough, this can result in a denial-of-service
		- A reflection attack becomes an **amplification** attack when the amount of traffic sent by the attacker is small, but it triggers a large amount of traffic to be sent from the reflector to the target
	- ### Man-in-the-Middle
		- A **Man-in-the-Middle** attack, the attacker places themselves between the source and destination to eavesdrop on communications, or to modify traffic before it reaches the destination
		- A common example is **ARP Spoofing**, also known as **ARP Poisoning** ^ccna-arp-poisoning
			- A host sends an ARP request, asking for the MAC address of another device
			- The target of the request sends an ARP reply, informing the requester of its MAC address
			- The attacker waits and sends another ARP reply after the legitimate replier
			- If the attacker's ARP reply arrives last, it will overwrite the legitimate ARP entry in the target PC's ARP table
			- In the target PC's ARP table, the entry for the requested resource will have the attacker's MAC address
			- When the target PC tries to send traffic to the requested resource, it will be forwarded to the attacker instead
			- The attacker can inspect the messages, and then forward them on to the requested resource
			- The attacker can also modify the messages before forwarding them to the requested resource
			- This compromises the Confidentiality and Integrity of communications
	- ### Reconnaissance
		- Reconnaissance attacks aren't attacks themselves, but they are used to gather information about a target which can be used for a future attack
		- This is often publicly available information
		- i.e. nslookup to learn the IP address of a site
		- Or a WHOIS query to learn email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc.
	- ### Malware
		- Malware (malicious software) refers to a variety of harmful programs that can infect a computer
		- **Viruses** infect other software (a 'host program'). The virus spreads as the software is shared by users, typically they corrupt or modify files on the target computer
		- **Worms** do not require a host program, they are standalone malware, and they are able to spread on their own, without user interaction. The spread of worms can congest the network, but the 'payload' of a worm can cause additional harm to target devices
		- **Trojan Horses** are harmful software that is disguised as legitimate software. They are spread through user interaction such as opening email attachments, or downloading a file from the Internet
		- Malware can exploit various vulnerabilities to threaten any of the CIA of the target device
	- ### Social Engineering
		- Social engineering attacks target the most vulnerable part of any system - people
		- They involve phycological manipulation to make the target reveal confidential information or perform some action
		- **Phishing** typically involves fraudulent emails that appear to come from a legitimate business (Amazon, bank, credit card company, etc.) and contain links to a fraudulent website that seems legitimate. Users are told to log in to the fraudulent website, providing their login credentials to the attacker
			- **Spear Phishing** is a more targeted form of phishing, i.e. aimed at employees of a certain company
			- **Whaling** is phishing targeted at high-profile individuals, i.e. a company president
		- **Vishing** (voice phishing) is phishing performed over the phone
		- **Smishing** (SMS phishing) is phishing using SMS text messages
		- **Watering Hole** attacks compromise sites that the target victim frequently visits. If a malicious link is placed on a website the target trusts, they might not hesitate to click it
		- **Tailgating** attacks involve entering restricted, secured areas by simply walking in behind an authorized person as they enter
			- Often, the target will hold the door open for the attacker to be polite, assuming the attacker is also authorized to enter
	- ### Password-Related
		- Most systems use a username/password combination to authenticate users
		- The username itself is often simple/easy to guess (for example, the user's email address), and the strength and secrecy f the password is relied on to provide the necessary security
		- Attackers can learn a user's passwords via multiple methods:
			- Guessing
			- **Dictionary Attack**: A program runs through a 'dictionary' or list of common words/passwords to find the target's password
			- **Brute Force Attack**: A program tries every possible combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to find the target's password
		- Strong passwords should contain:
		- At least 8 characters (preferably more)
		- A mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters
		- A mixture of letters and numbers
		- One or more special characters
		- Should be changed regularly
- ## Multi-Factor Authentication
	- **Multi-Factor Authentication** involves more than just a username/password to prove your identity
	- It usually involves providing two of the following (=two-factor authentication):
		- **Something you know**
			- A username/password, a PIN, etc.
		- **Something you have**
			- Pressing a notification that appears on your phone, a badge that is scanned, etc.
		- **Something you are**
			- Biometrics such as a face scan, palm scan, fingerprint scan, retina scan, etc.
	- Requiring multiple factors of authentication greatly increases the security, even if an attacker learns the target's password, they won't be able to log into the target's account
- ## Digital Certificates
	- **Digital Certificates** are another form of authentication used to prove the identity of the holder of the certificate
	- They are used for websites to verify that the website being accessed is legitimate
	- Entities that want a certificate to prove their identity send a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to a CA (Certificate Authority), which will generate and sign the certificate
- ## AAA
	- **AAA** (triple-A) stands for **A**uthentication, **A**uthorization, and **A**ccounting
	- It is a framework for controlling and monitoring users of a computer system (i.e. a network)
	- **Authentication** is the process of verifying a user's identity
		- Logging in
	- **Authorization** is the process of granting the user the appropriate access and permissions
		- Granting the user access to some files/services, restricting access to other files/services
	- **Accounting** is the process of recording the user's activities on the system
		- logging when a user makes a change to a file
	- Enterprises typically use a AAA server to provide AAA services
		- ISE (Identity Services Engine) is Cisco's AAA server
	- AAA servers usually support the following two AAA protocols:
		- RADIUS: an open standard protocol, uses UDP ports 1812 and 1813
		- TACAS+: A Cisco propriety protocol, uses TCP port 49
- ## Security Program Elements
	- **User Awareness** programs are designed to make employees aware of potential security threats and risks
		- For example, a company might send out false phishing emails to make employees click a link and sign in with their login credentials
		- Although the emails are harmless, employees who fall for the false emails will be informed that it is part of a user awareness program, and they should be more careful about phishing emails
	- **User Training** programs are more formal than user awareness programs
		- For example, dedicated training sessions which educate users on the corporate security policies, how to create strong passwords, and how to avoid potential threats
	- **Physical Access Control** protects equipment and data from potential attackers by only allowing authorized users into protected areas such as network closets or data center floors
		- Multifactor locks can protect access to restricted areas
			- I.E. a door that requires users to swipe a badge and scan their fingerprint to enter
			- Permissions of the badge can easily be changed, for example, permissions can be removed when an employee leaves the company
