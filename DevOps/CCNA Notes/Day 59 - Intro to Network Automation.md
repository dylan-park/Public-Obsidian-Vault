- ## Network Automation
	- In the traditional network management model, engineers manage devices one at a time by connecting to their CLI via [[Day 42 - SSH#^ccna-ssh|SSH]]
		- Some downsides of configuring devices one-by-one include:
			- Typos are other small mistakes are common
			- It is time-consuming and very inefficient in large-scale networks
			- It is difficult to ensure that all devices adhere to the organization's standard configurations
	- Network automation provides many key benefits:
		- Human error (typos) is reduced
		- Networks become much more scalable. New deployments, network-wide changes, and troubleshooting can be implemented in a fraction of the time
		- Network-wide policy compliance can be assured (standard configurations, software versions, etc.)
		- The improved efficiency of network operations reduces the opex (operating expenses) of the network, as each task requires fewer man-hours
	- There are various tools/methods that can be used to automate tasks in the network:
		- SDN (Software-Defined Networking)
		- [[Day 63 - Ansible, Puppet, & Chef#^ccna-ansible|Ansible]]
		- [[Day 63 - Ansible, Puppet, & Chef#^ccna-puppet|Puppet]]
		- Python Scripts
- ## Logical Planes
	- **What does a router do?**
		- It forwards messages between networks by examining information in the Layer 3 header
		- It uses a routing protocol like OSPF to share route information with other routers and build a routing table
		- It uses ARP to build an ARP table, mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses
		- It uses Syslog to keep logs of events that occur
		- It allows a user to connect to it via [[Day 42 - SSH#^ccna-ssh|SSH]] and manage it
	- **What does a switch do?**
		- It forwards messages within a LAN by examining information in the Layer 2 header
		- It uses STP to ensure there are no Layer 2 loops in the network
		- It builds a MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of frames
		- It uses Syslog to keep logs of events that occur
		- It allows a user to connect to it via [[Day 42 - SSH#^ccna-ssh|SSH]] and manage it
	- The various functions of network devices can be logically divided up (categorized) into planes:
	- ### Data Plane
		- All tasks involved in forwarding user data/traffic from one interface to another are part of the **data plane**
		- A router receives a message, looks for the most specific matching route in its routing table, and forwards it out of the appropriate interface to the next hop
			- It also de-encapsulates the original Layer 2 header, and re-encapsulates with a new header destined for the next hop's MAC address
		- A switch received a message, looks at the destination MAC address, and forwards it out of the appropriate interface (or floods it)
			- This includes functions like adding or removing 802.1q VLAN tags
		- NAT (changing the source/destination addresses before forwarding) is part of the data plane
		- Deciding to forward or discard messages due to ACLs, port security, etc. is part of the data plane
		- The data plane is also called the 'forwarding plane'
	- ### Control Plane
		- How does a device's data plane make its forwarding decisions?
			- Routing table, MAC address table, ARP table, STP, etc.
		- Functions that build these tables (and other functions that influence the data plane) are part of the **control plane**
		- The control plane *controls* what the data plane does, for example, by building the router's routing table
		- The control plane performs *overhead* work
			- OSPF itself doesn't forward user data packets, but it informs the data plane about how packets should be forwarded
			- STP itself isn't directly involved in the process of forwarding frames, but it informs the data plane about which interfaces should and shouldn't be used to forward frames
			- ARP messages aren't user data, but they are used to build an ARP table which is used in the process of forwarding data
		- In traditional networking, the data plane and control plane are both distributed. Each device has its own data plane, and its own control plane. The planes are 'distributed' throughout the network
	- ### Management Plane
		- Like the control plane, the **management plane** performs overhead work
			- However, the management plane doesn't directly affect the forwarding of messages in the data plane
		- The management plane consists of protocols that are used to manage devices
			- [[Day 42 - SSH#^ccna-ssh|SSH]]/[[Day 42 - SSH#^ccna-telnet|Telnet]], used to connect to the CLI of a device to configure/manage it
			- Syslog, used to keep logs of events that occur on the device
			- SNMP, used to monitor the operations of the device
			- NTP, used to maintain accurate time on the device
		- The Data plane is the reason we buy routers and switches, to forward messages. However, the Control plane and Management plane are both necessary to enable the data plane to do its job
	- ### ASICs
		- The operations of the Management plane and Control plane are usually managed by the CPU
		- However, this is not desirable for data plane operations because CPU processing is slow
		- Instead, a specialized hardware **ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)** is used, ASICs are chips built for specific purposes
		- Using a switch as an example:
			- When a frame is received, the ASIC (not the CPU) is responsible for the switching logic
			- The MAC address table is stored in a kind of memory called TCAM (Ternary Content-Addressable Memory)
				- Another common name for the MAC address table is *CAM table*
			- The ASIC feeds the destination MAC address of the frame into the TCAM, which returns the matching MAC address table entry
			- The frame is then forwarded out of the appropriate interface
		- Modern routers also use a similar hardware data plane: an ASIC designed for forwarding logic, and tables stored in TCAM
- ## Software-Defined Networking
	- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** is an approach to networking that centralized the control plane into an application called a controller
		- Like Wireless LAN Controllers
	- DSN is also called **Software-Defined Architecture (SDA)** or **Controller-Based Networking**
	- Traditional control planes use a distributed architecture
		- For example, each router in a network runs OSPF and the routers share routing information and then calculate their preferred routes to each destination
	- An SDN controller centralized control plane functions like calculating routes
	- The controller can interact programmatically with the network device using [[Day 61 - REST APIs#^ccna-apis|APIs (Application Programming Interface)]]
	- ### Southbound Interface (SBI)
		- The SBI is used for communications between the controller and the network devices it controls
		- It typically consists of a communication protocol and [[Day 61 - REST APIs#^ccna-apis|APIs (Application Programming Interface)]]
		- APIs facilitate data exchanges between programs
			- Data is exchanged between the controller and the network devices
			- An API on the network devices allows the controller to access information on the devices, control their data plane tables, etc.
		- Some examples of SBIs:
			- OpenFlow
			- Cisco OpFlex
			- Cisco onePK (Open Network Environment Platform Kit)
			- NETCONF
	- ### Northbound Interface (NBI)
		- Using the SBI, the controller communicates with the managed devices and gathers information about them:
			- The devices in the network
			- The topology (how the devices are connected together)
			- The available interfaces on each device
			- Their configurations
		- The **Northbound Interface** is what allows us to interact with the controller, access the data it gathers about the network, program it, and make changes in the network via the SBI
		- A *[[Day 61 - REST APIs#^ccna-rest|REST API]]* is used on the controller as an interface for apps to interact with it
			- REST = Representational State Transfer
		- Data is sent in a structured (*serialized*) format such as [[Day 60 - JSON, XML, & YAML#^ccna-json|JSON]] or [[Day 60 - JSON, XML, & YAML#^ccna-xml|XML]]
			- This makes it much easier for programs to use the data
- ## Automation in Traditional Networks vs SDN
	- Networking tasks can be automated in traditional network architectures too:
		- Scripts can be written (i.e. using Python) to push commands to many devices at once
		- Python with good use of Regular Expressions can parse through **show** commands to gather information about the network devices
	- However, the robust and centralized data collected by SDN controllers greatly facilitates these functions
		- The controller collects information about all devices in the network
		- Northbound APIs allow apps to access information in a format that is easy for programs to understand (i.e. JSON, XML)
		- The centralized data facilitates network-wide analytics
	- SDN tools can provide the benefits of automation without the requirement of third-party scripts & apps
		- You don't need expertise in automation to make use of SDN tools
		- However, APIs allow third-party applications to interact with the controller, which can be very powerful
	- Although SDN and automation aren't the same thing, the SDN architecture greatly facilitates the automation of various tasks in the network via the SDN controller and APIs
