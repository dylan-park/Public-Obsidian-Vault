- **Routing** - The process that routers use to determine the path that IP packets should take over a network to reach their destination
	- Routers store routes to all of their known destinations in a **routing table**
	- When routers receive packets, they look in the routing table to find the best route to forward that packet
- ## 2 main routing methods:
	- ### Dynamic Routing
		- Routers use dynamic routing protocols (ie. OSPF) to share routing information with each other automatically and build their routing tables
	- ### Static Routing
		- A network engineer/admin manually configures routes on the router
- **Route** - Tells the router: to send a packet to destination X, you should send the packet to next-hop Y
	- **next-hop** = the next router in the path to the destination
	- Or, if the destination is directly connected to the router, send the packet directly to the destination
	- Or, if the destination is the router's own IP address, receive the packet for yourself (don't forward it)
- `show ip route` command shows a router's routing table
	- The Codes legend in the output lists the different protocols which routers can use to learn routes
		- L - Local: A route to the actual IP address configured on the interface (with a /32 netmask)
			- A route to the exact IP address configured on the interface. A /32 netmask is used to specify the exact IP address of the interface.
		- C - Connected: A route to the network the interface is connected to (with the actual netmask configured on the interface)
			- A route to the network the interface is connected to (provides a route to all hosts in that network)
	- When you configure an IP address on an interface and enable it with no shutdown, 2 routes (per interface) will be automatically added to the routing table:
		- A connected route
		- A local route
- A router will choose the most specific matching route when a packet might be matched by multiple routes.
	- Most specific matching route = the <u>matching route</u> with the longest prefix length.
