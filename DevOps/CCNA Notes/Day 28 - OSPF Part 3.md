- ## Loopback Interfaces
	- A loopback interface is a virtual interface in the router
	- It is always up/up unless you manually shut it down
	- It is not dependent on a physical interface
	- It provides a consistent IP address that can be used to reach/identify the router
- ## OSPF Network Types
	- The OSPF 'network type' refers to the type of connection between OSPF neighbors (Ethernet, etc.)
	- You can configure the OSPF network type on an interface with the `ip ospf network *type*` command
	- ### Broadcast
		- Enabled by default on Ethernet and FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interfaces) interfaces
		- Routers *dynamically* discover neighbors by sending/listening for OSPF Hello messages used multicast address 224.0.0.5
		- A DR (designated router) and BDR (backup designated router) must be elected on each subnet (only DR if there are no OSPF neighbors)
			- Routers which aren't the DR or BDR become a DROther
		- #### The DR/BDR election order of priority:
			1. Highest OSPF interface priority
			2. Highest OSPF Router ID
			
			- 'First place' becomes the DR for the subnet, 'second place' becomes the BDR
			- The default OSPF interface priority is 1 on all interfaces
				- `ip ospf priority *priority*` command sets the priority of an interface
				- If you set the OSPF interface priority to 0, the router CANNOT be the DR/BDR for the subnet
			- The DR/BDR election is non-preemptive. Once the DR/BDR are selected they will keep their role until OSPF is reset, the interface fails/is shutdown, etc.
			- When the DR goes down, the BDR becomes the new DR. Then an election is held for the next BDR
			- DROthers will only move to the FULL state with the DR and BDR. The neighbor state with other DROthers will be 2-way
				- Routers only exchange LSAs with the DR and BDR, DROthers will not exchange LSAs with each other
				- All routers will still have the same LSDB, but this reduces the amount of LSAs flooding the network
	- ### Point-to-point
		- Enabled by default on PPP (Point-to-Point protocol) and HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) **serial** interfaces
		- Routers dynamically discover neighbors by sending/listening for OSPF Hello messages using multicast address 224.0.0.5
		- A DR and BDR are not elected
			- These encapsulations are used for 'point-to-point' connections, therefore there is no point in electing a DR and BDR
			- The two routers will form a Full adjacency with each other
		- #### Serial Interfaces
			- One side of a serial connection functions as DCE (Data Communications Equipment)
			- The other side functions as DTA (Data Terminal Equipment)
			- The DCE side needs to specify the *clock rate* (speed) of the connection
			- The default encapsulation on a serial interface is HDLC (cHDLC (Cisco HDLC))
			- `show controllers *interface-id*` command shows serial information for the interface
	- ### Non-broadcast
		- Enabled by default on Frame Relay and X.25 interfaces
- ## OSPF Neighbor Requirements
	1. Area number must match
	2. Interfaces must be in the same subnet
	3. OSPF process must not be **shutdown**
	4. OSPF Router IDs must be unique
	5. Hello and Dead timers must match
	6. Authentication settings must match
		- `ip ospf authentication-key *password*` command will set the OSPF password on the interface
	7. IP MTU settings must match
		- Can become OSPF neighbors, but OSPF doesn't operate properly
	8. OSPF Network Type must match
		- Can become OSPF neighbors, but OSPF doesn't operate properly
- ## OSPF LSA Types
	- OSPF LSDB is made up of LSAs
	- There are 11 types of LSA, only 3 are on the CCNA
		- Type 1 (Router LSA)
			- Every OSPF router generates this type of LSA
			- It identifies the router using its router ID
			- It also lists networks attached to the router's OSPF-activated interfaces
		- Type 2 (Network LSA)
			- Generated by the DR of each 'multi-access' network (i.e. the **broadcast** network type)
			- Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network
		- Type 5 (AS External LSA)
			- Generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destinations outside the AS (OSPF domain)
