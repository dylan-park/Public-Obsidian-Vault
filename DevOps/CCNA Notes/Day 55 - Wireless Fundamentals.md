- ## Wireless Networks
	- The standards we use for wireless LANs are defined in IEEE 802.11
	- The term **Wi-Fi** is a trademark of the **Wi-Fi Alliance**, not directly connected to the IEEE
	- The Wi-Fi Alliance tests and certifies equipment for 802.11 standards compliance and interoperability with other devices
	- Wireless networks have some issues that need to be dealt with:
		1. All devices within range receive all frames, like devices connected to an Ethernet hub
			- Privacy of data within the LAN is a greater concern
			- CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) is used to facilitate half-duplex communications
				- **[[Day 9 - Switch Interfaces#^ccna-csmacd|CSMA/CD]]** is used in wired networks to detect and recover from collisions
				- **CSMA/CA** is used in wireless networks to avoid collisions
			- When using **CSMA/CD**, a device will wait for other devices to stop transmitting before it transmits data itself
		2. Wireless communications are regulated by various international and national bodies
		3. Wireless signal coverage area must be considered
			- Signal range
			- ### Signal Absorption
				- **Absorption** happens when a wireless signal passes through a material and is converted into heat, weakening the original signal
			- ### Signal Reflection
				- **Reflection** happens when a signal bounces off of a material, for example metal
					- This is why Wi-Fi reception is usually poor in elevators, the signal bounces off the metal and very little penetrates into the elevator
			- ### Signal Refraction
				- **Refraction** happens when a wave is bent when entering a medium where the signal travels at a different speed
					- For example, glass and water can refract waves
			- ### Signal Diffraction
				- **Diffraction** happens when a wave encounters an obstacle and travels around it
					- This can result in 'blind spots' behind the obstacle
			- ### Signal Scattering
				- **Scattering** happens when a material causes a signal to scatter in all directions
					- Dust, smog, uneven surfaces, etc. can cause scattering
		4. Other devices using the same channels can cause interference
			- For example, a wireless LAN in your neighbor's house/apartment
- ## Radio Frequency
	- To send wireless signals, the sender applied an alternating current to an antenna
		- This creates electromagnetic fields which propagate out as waves
	- Electromagnetic waves can be measured in multiple ways for example **amplitude** and **frequency**
	- **Amplitude** is the maximum strength of the electric and magnetic fields
	- **Frequency** measures the number of up/down cycles per a given unit of time
		- The most common measurement of frequency is **hertz**
			- Hz (Hertz) = cycles per second
			- kHz (Kilohertz) = 1,000 cycles per second
			- MHz (Megahertz) = 1,000,000 cycles per second
			- GHz (Gigahertz) = 1,000,000,000 cycles per second
			- THz (Terahertz) = 1,000,000,000,000 cycles per second
	- **Period** is the amount of time in one cycle
		- If the **frequency** is 4 Hz, the **period** is 0.25 seconds
	- The visible frequency range is about 400 THz to 790 THz
	- The radio frequency range is from 30 Hz to 300 GHz and is used for many purposes
	- ### Radio Frequency Bands
		- Wi-Fi uses two main *bands* (frequency ranges)
			- **2.4GHz** band
				- The actual range is **2.400 GHz** to **2.4835 GHz**
			- **5 GHz** band
				- The actual range is from **5.150 GHz** to **5.825 GHz**
				- Divided into four smaller bands:
					- **5.150 GHz** to **5.250 GHz**
					- **5.250 GHz** to **5.350 GHz**
					- **5.470 GHz** to **5.725 GHz**
					- **5.725 GHz** to **5.825 GHz**
		- The 2.4 GHz band typically provides further reach in open space and better penetration of obstacles such as walls
			- However, more devices tend to use the 2.4 GHz band, so interference can be a bigger problem compared to the 5 GHz band
		- **Wi-Fi 6** (802.11ax) has expanded the spectrum range to include a band in the **6GHz** range
	- ### RF Channels
		- Each band is divided up into multiple 'channels'
			- Devices are configured to transmit and receive traffic on one (or more) of these channels
		- The 2.4 GHz band is divided into several channels, each with a 22 MHz range
		- In a small wireless LAN with only a single AP, you can use any channel
		- However, in larger WLANs with multiple APs, it's important that adjacent APs don't use overlapping channels, this helps to avoid interference
		- In the 2.4 GHz band, it is recommended to use channels 1, 6 and 11
		- The 5 GHz band consists of non-overlapping channels, so it is much easier to avoid interference between adjacent APs
		- Using channels 1, 6, and 11, you can place APs in a 'honeycomb' pattern to provide complete coverage of an area without interference between channels

- ## Service Sets
	- 802.11 defines different kinds of **service sets** which are groups of wireless network devices
	- There are three main types:
		- Independent
		- Infrastructure
		- Mesh
	- All devices in a service set share the same **SSID (service set identifier)**
	- The SSID is a human-readable name which identifies the service set
	- The SSID does **not** have to be unique
	- ### IBSS
		- An **IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set)** is a wireless network in which two or more wireless devices connect directly without using an **AP (Access Point)**
		- Also called an **ad hoc** network
		- Can be used for file transfer (i.e. AirDrop)
		- Not scalable beyond a few devices
	- ### BSS
		- A **BSS (Basic Service Set)** is a kind of Infrastructure Service Set in which clients connect to each other via an **AP (Access Point)**, but not directly to each other
		- A **BSSID (Basic Service Set ID)** is sued to uniquely identify the AP
			- Other APs can use the same SSID, but not the same BSSID
			- The BSSID is the MAC address of the AP's radio
		- Wireless devices request to *associate* with the BSS
		- Wireless devices that have associated with the BSS are called 'clients' or 'stations'
		- The area around an AP where its signal is usable is called a **BSA (Basic Service Area)**
		- Clients must communicate via the AP, not directly with each other
	- ### ESS
		- To create larger wireless LANs beyond the range of a single AP, use an **ESS (Extended Service Set)**
		- APs with their own BSSs are connected by a wired network
			- Each BSS uses the same SSID
			- Each BSS has a unique BSSID
			- Each BSS uses a different channel to avoid interference
		- Clients can pass between APs without having to reconnect, providing a seamless Wi-Fi experience when moving between APs
			- This is called **roaming**
		- The BSAs should overlap about 10-15%
	- ### MBSS
		- An **MBSS (Mesh Basic Service Set** can be used in situations where it's difficult to run an Ethernet connection to every AP
		- Mesh APs use two radios:
			- One to provide a BSS to wireless clients
			- One to form a 'backhaul network' which is used to bridge traffic from AP to AP
		- At least one AP is connected to the wired network, and it is called the **RAP (Root Access Point)**
		- The other APs are called **MAP**s **(Mesh Access Points)**
		- A protocol is used to determine the best path through the mesh (similar to how dynamic routing protocols are used to determine the best path to a destination)
- ## Distribution System
	- Most wireless networks aren't standalone networks
		- Rather, they are a way for wireless clients to connect to the wired network infrastructure
	- In 802.11, the upstream wired network is called the **DS (Distribution System)**
	- Each wireless BSS of ESS is mapped to a VLAN in the wired network.
	- It's possible for an AP to provide multiple wireless LANs, each with a unique SSID
	- Each WLAN is mapped to a separate VLAN and connected to the wired network via a trunk
- ## Additional AP Operational Modes
	- APs can operate in additional modes beyond the ones introduces so far
	- An AP in **repeater** mode can be used to extend the range of a BSS
		- The repeater will simply retransmit any signal it receives from the AP
			- A repeater with a single radio must operate on the same channel as the AP, but this can drastically reduce the overall throughput on the channel
			- A repeater with two radios can receive on one channel, and then retransmit on another channel
	- An AP working as a **workgroup bridge** (WGB) operates as a wireless client of another AP, and can be used to connect wired devices to the wireless network
		- There are two kinds of WGBs:
			- **Universal WGB (uWGB)** is an 802.11 standard that allows one device to be bridged to a wireless network
			- **WGB** is a Cisco-proprietary version of the 802.11 standard that allows multiple wired clients to be bridged to the wireless network
	- An AP working as an **outdoor bridge** can be used to connect network over long distances without a physical cable connecting them
		- The APs will use specialized antennas that focus most of the signal power in one direction, which allows the wireless connection to be made over longer distances than normally possible
		- The connection can be point-to-point, or point-to-multipoint in which multiple sites connect to one central site
